<p>This is a mock of a logo redesing for a small meat and grocery store. Large companies will have enough customers that a textless logo can become ubiquitious with their brand. Smaller compaines do not have such a luxury and I decided that it was important that the logo included the name. Various icons are also included so that packaging can be specific to the product being sold. This is a small touch which is intended to demonstrate to the customer that the store is attentive to every detail about the customer's needs.</p>
<br>
<p>Below is a sample of what packaging might look like. The logo is transformed to a simple one color design which can be printed on a variety of materials. I think this is a good example of why making the name a large portion of the logo is important. Anyone who sees this packaging will immediately be able to tell where the meat was purchased even without prior knowledge of the store.</p>
