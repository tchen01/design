<p>When creating a cover for the classic novel, <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em> I wantted to take some themes from the novel and incoporate them into a powerful yet simple design.</p><br>
<img src="projects/mockingbird/book.png" class="nopad">
<br>
<p>The scene in the book where Atticus prevnts the lynching of Tom is one of the most critical points in the story, and is where I took inspiration for the design. At that point in the novel there is a conflict between life and death, due course and mob justice, rationality and racism, and other contradictory ideas. 
</p><br><p>    
I tried to emulate the stark contrast of these themes by highlighting a single hanging noose against a dark background. The minimalistic design and somewhat morbid image of the noose are intended to bring the viewer's attention to the book, without being distracting or overwhelming.</p>
